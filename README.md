Goal/s:
Develop a responsive website for the Mario Totzek Group, showcasing its four main business areas: financial services, tourism, property, and recruitment. The website should feature a modern design with easy navigation, highlighting the group's services and providing contact information. The site will cater to both desktop and mobile users, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

### **Framework: Django**

**Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development**

**I used a template for admin panel. The admin panel has: account, authentication & authorization, category, document_upload, token blacklist**

**The "Category" has 4 categories: Financial Services, Property, Recruitment.**
